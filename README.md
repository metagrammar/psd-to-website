Exercise to transform a .PSD file into a website.

Noteworthy features:
.All linkable elements have hover state (change of colour or opacity).

. Navbar hidden on scroll down with js. Mainly because of the anchors to which the page scrolls from the links in the navbar. Without this hide feature, the section would be partially covered by the navbar.

. The Navbar's link's active classes are written / deleted dynamically with js.

.There is a scroll spy that shows the sections that are being scrolled past by setting the active state (blue colour) of the navbar's links. This is a Bootstrap feature, so easy to implement.

.The background image for the Team section was not provided in the assets folder, so that was added.

Not so noteworthy:
. Wasn't able to make it fully responsive, so next time must plan better.

Notes:
.Used a mix of <svg> tag to host SVG code directly in the HTML, but also tried importing .svg files through the <img> tag, as well as using .png files.
